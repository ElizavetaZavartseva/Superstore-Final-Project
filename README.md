Dataset: https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/fatihilhan/global-superstore-dataset/data 

The Kaggle Global Superstore dataset is a comprehensive dataset containing information about sales and orders in a global superstore. It is a valuable resource for data analysis and visualization tasks.

## Goals:

1. Analyze the performance of the superstore by examining sales, profit, and customer behavior across different regions, product categories, and market segments.
2. Provide actionable insights into sales trends and operational efficiency, with a focus on improving profitability and strategic decision-making through data-driven analysis.
3. Design and implement a robust and scalable database system that effectively supports the data analysisâ€™ needs.

## Steps:

1. **Data Cleaning and Preparation:**
   - Removing irrelevant columns.
   - Handle missing values and inconsistencies.
   - Identify and deal with duplicated values.
   - Standardize Data.

3. **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):**
   - Visualize and summarize key metrics.
   - Identify trends, correlations, and anomalies.

4. **Performance Analysis:**
   - Evaluate sales, profit, and other key metrics by region, product, and customer segment.

5. **Database Schema Creation:**
   - Design and create a MySQL database schema to store and manage the superstore's data efficiently.
  
6. **Visualization:**
  - Dashboards: Create visualizations and dashboards to provide an overview of sales, profit, and other key metrics. 


## Steps:

1. The most important countries are: US, China, India, UK and France
2. The most profitable categories are: Copiers, Appliances and Bookcases
3. This project highlights weak spots of this retail business that can be improved to increase profitability:
- Tables is the most unprofitable category
- Profitability of Tables can potentially be improved by excluding discounts 40-60% by saving money on storage
4. Convinient DB schema was created to provide fast data analysis
