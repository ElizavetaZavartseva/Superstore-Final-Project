- Seasonal Trends: Examine how sales and profit vary by different times of the year or holidays.

10. Correlation Analysis:
- Correlation Between Variables: Explore the relationships between variables such as quantity and sales, or discount and profit, to identify any significant correlations.

11. Create and Implement a MySQL Database:
- Design and create a MySQL database schema to store and manage the superstore's data efficiently.

12. Visualization:
- Dashboards: Create visualizations and dashboards to provide an overview of sales, profit, and other key metrics.
